              produce while presenting it in an approachable way.

            <p class="project-paragraph"> In order to reverse the trend in decreasing profit margins, Whole Foods is now attempting to attract a new set of consumers, within food deserts. However, they are currently facing three frictions as they are viewed, outside of the aspirational
              class, as unaffordable, inaccessible, and unapproachable </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph"> Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods has solved the friction of unaffordability, through their reduced prices, and has created a newfound opportunity to leverage Amazon’s industry leading digital channel infrastructure to make Whole Foods more
              accessible to a wider demographic and more approachable to people who traditionally viewed organic food as a luxury.

            <p class="project-paragraph "> I found this project interesting as the Whole Foods and Amazon merger is quite recent so there weren’t many constraints when making a proposal. What I enjoyed most about this project was that we got to utilize the strengths of both brands to better accommodate a neglected demographic. My goal in the future is to cater more design projects towards a situation or environment where I can help people in need.   </p>
