<p class="project-paragraph extra-3-rem-top-margin "> We reduced the amount of information shown at once and improved the visual hierarchy so  that the surfer see what is  most important to them such as their top distance, speed, or air height. They are also given a quick,clean, visual overview of their waves with the option to get more details further below, thus reducing the cognitive overload with too much information being presented at once</p>

We had to consider multiple touchpoints and constantly had to adjust our methods in order to create a seamless experience. My main take-away from this project was realizing the importance of creating persona’s to better understand who you are designing for. I have never surfed in my life before, but through my research I was able to distinguish what information would actually be relevant to a surfer. Going forward I will continue to create persona’s so that my design decisions are valuable to the end user.</p>
